# TIC-TAC-TOE

Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game
Description:
I am thrilled to present my Tic Tac Toe game, a project that showcases my proficiency in front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This classic game has been reimagined with a modern twist, offering a responsive and engaging user experience.
Technologies Used:
* HTML: The foundation of the game structure, providing the necessary markup for the grid and elements.
* CSS: Styling elements and creating an aesthetically pleasing interface. CSS is utilized for layout design, colors, and responsive design to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience on various devices.
* JavaScript: The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, allowing for dynamic and interactive gameplay. Event handling, user input validation, and game state management are all powered by JavaScript to create a seamless gaming experience.
